The internet has changed a lot since I was first dabbling at 11 years old.

I'm now using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com "Netlify").

Customisations I've made:

- Changed title to SVG and updated colour
- Modified the overal width
- Updated to Google fonts, and amended sizes and line-heights
- Created 'in brief' and 'in depth' tags
- Display these tags as post metadata on the main list, with custom colour
- Update formatting for post entries based on the tag
- Changed some other list behaviours, e.g. so 'in brief' are displayed in full
